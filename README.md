Maximized the expected profit from pizza sales at home baseball games in Sacramento by analyzing production and demand for two types of pizzas: plain cheese and veggie-and-cheese combo.

Calculated the profit (or loss) associated with producing at different possible demand levels for both plain cheese and veggie-and-cheese combo pizzas. For instance, determined the profit if 200 plain cheese pizzas were produced and 200 were demanded, and similarly calculated the profit if 200 pizzas were produced but 300 were demanded. Summarized the results in a two-way data table using R, where rows corresponded to demand levels and columns to production levels. Created two such tables—one for plain cheese and another for veggie-and-cheese pizzas.

Computed the expected profit for each possible production level for both types of pizzas by calculating the expected values. This involved generating two vectors of expected profits—one for plain cheese and another for veggie-and-cheese pizzas.

Maximized the expected profit by analyzing the expected profit vectors from the previous step. Determined the optimal number of pizzas to produce for each type based on the highest expected profit.
